# scam-database-attack

A python script to attack specific websites known to scam people

## What does this do

The sites are using jQuery for their website to take in information, however with the implementation of verifying information, there is a little catch.

For skinamerica.fun it would verify it against Steam itself, but this script rips out the verification and just spams data anyway

# How to run

***Recommended to run in a VPN***

1. Clone repo
2. Run batch script
