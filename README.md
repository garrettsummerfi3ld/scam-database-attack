# scam-database-attack

A set of python scripts to attack specific websites known to scam people

## What does this do

The sites are using jQuery for their website to take in information, however with the implementation of verifying information, there is a little catch.

For `skinamerica.fun` it would verify it against Steam itself, but this script rips out the verification and just spams data anyway, but does this rapidly in a DDoS fashion.

For `bsctmw.com` this just send random login information in a basic DDoS fashion.
